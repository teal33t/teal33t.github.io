                                    As developers, we often find ourselves repeating the same tasks over and over again. Whether it's setting up a new project, 
                                    running tests, or deploying code, these repetitive tasks can consume a significant amount of our time. In this post, 
                                    I'll share some practical Bash scripts that you can use to automate common development tasks and boost your productivity.
                                </p>

                                <h2>Why Use Bash Scripts?</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is the default shell on most Linux distributions and macOS. It's a powerful scripting language 
                                    that allows you to automate tasks by running commands in sequence. Here are some reasons why Bash scripts are a great choice 
                                    for automation:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>They're built into your system (no need to install additional software)</li>
                                    <li>They can interact with the filesystem, network, and other programs</li>
                                    <li>They're relatively easy to write and understand</li>
                                    <li>They can be easily shared with others</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h2>Script 1: Project Scaffolding</h2>
                                <p>
                                    One of the most repetitive tasks in development is setting up a new project. The following script creates a basic 
                                    project structure for a Node.js application, including directories for source code, tests, and documentation.
                                </p>
                                <pre><code>#!/bin/bash

# create_node_project.sh
# Creates a basic structure for a Node.js project

if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    echo "Usage: ./create_node_project.sh project_name"
    exit 1
fi

PROJECT_NAME=$1

# Create project directory
mkdir -p $PROJECT_NAME/{src,tests,docs}

# Initialize git repository
cd $PROJECT_NAME
git init

# Create basic files
touch README.md
touch .gitignore
touch src/index.js
touch tests/index.test.js

# Add basic content to README.md
echo "# $PROJECT_NAME" > README.md
echo "" >> README.md
echo "A description of your project." >> README.md

# Add node_modules to .gitignore
echo "node_modules/" > .gitignore
echo "*.log" >> .gitignore

# Initialize npm
npm init -y

# Install basic dependencies
npm install --save-dev jest

echo "Project $PROJECT_NAME created successfully!"
</code></pre>

                                <p>
                                    To use this script, save it as <code>create_node_project.sh</code>, make it executable with <code>chmod +x create_node_project.sh</code>, 
                                    and then run it with <code>./create_node_project.sh my_project</code>.
                                </p>

                                <h2>Script 2: Git Workflow Automation</h2>
                                <p>
                                    If you're working with Git, you probably perform the same sequence of commands multiple times a day. The following script 
                                    automates the process of updating your feature branch with the latest changes from the main branch.
                                </p>
                                <pre><code>#!/bin/bash

# git_update.sh
# Updates the current branch with changes from the main branch

# Get the current branch name
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)

# Define the main branch (change to 'master' if needed)
MAIN_BRANCH="main"

# Check if the current branch is the main branch
if [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" = "$MAIN_BRANCH" ]; then
    echo "You are already on the $MAIN_BRANCH branch."
    exit 0
fi

# Stash any uncommitted changes
git stash

# Checkout the main branch and pull latest changes
git checkout $MAIN_BRANCH
git pull

# Checkout back to the feature branch
git checkout $CURRENT_BRANCH

# Merge the main branch into the feature branch
git merge $MAIN_BRANCH

# Apply the stashed changes if there are any
git stash pop

echo "Successfully updated $CURRENT_BRANCH with the latest changes from $MAIN_BRANCH."
</code></pre>

                                <h2>Script 3: Database Backup</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Regular database backups are essential for any project. The following script creates a backup of a PostgreSQL database 
                                    and compresses it into a timestamped file.
                                </p>
                                <pre><code>#!/bin/bash

# backup_postgres.sh
# Creates a backup of a PostgreSQL database

# Database credentials
DB_USER="your_db_user"
DB_NAME="your_db_name"

# Backup directory
BACKUP_DIR="$HOME/backups"

# Create backup directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p $BACKUP_DIR

# Generate timestamp
TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")

# Backup filename
BACKUP_FILE="$BACKUP_DIR/${DB_NAME}_${TIMESTAMP}.sql.gz"

# Create the backup
echo "Creating backup of $DB_NAME..."
pg_dump -U $DB_USER $DB_NAME | gzip > $BACKUP_FILE

# Check if the backup was successful
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Backup created successfully: $BACKUP_FILE"
else
    echo "Backup failed!"
    exit 1
fi

# Delete backups older than 7 days
find $BACKUP_DIR -name "${DB_NAME}_*.sql.gz" -mtime +7 -delete

echo "Deleted old backups (older than 7 days)."
</code></pre>

                                <p>
                                    Remember to adjust the database credentials in this script before using it.
                                </p>

                                <h2>Script 4: Deployment Script</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Deploying code can involve multiple steps. The following script automates a basic deployment process for a web application.
                                </p>
                                <pre><code>#!/bin/bash

# deploy.sh
# Deploys a web application to a server

# Configuration
SERVER_USER="your_server_user"
SERVER_HOST="your_server_host"
SERVER_PATH="/var/www/your_app"
REPO_URL="https://github.com/your_username/your_repo.git"
BRANCH="main"

# Local build directory
BUILD_DIR="./build"

echo "Starting deployment process..."

# Ensure we're on the right branch
git checkout $BRANCH

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin $BRANCH

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
npm test

# If tests fail, exit
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Tests failed. Deployment aborted."
    exit 1
fi

# Build the application
npm run build

# Deploy to the server
echo "Deploying to server..."
rsync -avz --delete $BUILD_DIR/ $SERVER_USER@$SERVER_HOST:$SERVER_PATH

# Restart the application on the server
ssh $SERVER_USER@$SERVER_HOST "cd $SERVER_PATH && pm2 restart app"

echo "Deployment completed successfully!"
</code></pre>

                                <h2>Making Scripts Accessible from Anywhere</h2>
                                <p>
                                    To make your scripts accessible from anywhere in your system, you can add them to a directory that's in your PATH. 
                                    Here's how:
                                </p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Create a bin directory in your home folder: <code>mkdir -p ~/bin</code></li>
                                    <li>Copy your scripts to this directory</li>
                                    <li>Make them executable: <code>chmod +x ~/bin/*.sh</code></li>
                                    <li>Add the bin directory to your PATH by adding the following line to your <code>~/.bashrc</code> or <code>~/.zshrc</code> file:
                                        <code>export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"</code></li>
                                    <li>Reload your shell configuration: <code>source ~/.bashrc</code> or <code>source ~/.zshrc</code></li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>
                                    Now you can run your scripts from anywhere without specifying the full path.
                                </p>

                                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Bash scripts are a powerful tool for automating repetitive tasks in your development workflow. By investing a little time 
                                    in creating these scripts, you can save countless hours in the long run and reduce the risk of human error.
                                </p>
                                <p>
